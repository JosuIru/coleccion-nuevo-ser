### Deploying a Being to a Crisis

**Step-by-Step:**

   → Crisis detail panel opens

2. REVIEW crisis requirements
   → See which attributes are needed
   → Check difficulty and rewards

3. TAP "Select Being"
   → List of available beings appears
   → Beings with matching attributes highlighted

4. SELECT a being
   → View success probability (%)
   → Higher = better attribute match

5. TAP "Deploy" (costs 10 energy)
   → Being enters "Deployed" status
   → Timer starts (15-60 min depending on difficulty)

6. WAIT for timer to complete
   → You can leave app and come back
   → Notification sent when complete (if enabled)

7. TAP "Collect Rewards"
   → Success: Full XP + Consciousness
   → Failure: Partial rewards
   → Being returns to "Available" status
```

**Tips:**
- Match being's dominant attribute to crisis type
- Higher attribute values = higher success chance
- Save high-level beings for difficult crises

## FAQ

### General

**Q: Is this game free?**
A: Yes! Core gameplay is 100% free. Optional premium pass ($4.99/mo) provides convenience (2x energy regen, extra slots) but no gameplay advantage.

**Q: Can I play offline?**
A: Partially. You can read books and manage beings offline, but collecting fractals and deploying to crises requires internet.

**Q: Does this drain my battery?**
A: We optimized for battery life. Expect ~5% drain per hour with GPS active. You can disable GPS and play in "desk mode."

**Q: What happens to my web account?**
A: Nothing! The mobile game is completely separate and optional. Your web account remains untouched.

---

### Gameplay

**Q: How do I get more beings?**
A:
1. Read books (syncs from web)
2. Use Frankenstein Lab on web app
3. Fuse beings at Level 5+ (mobile)

**Q: Why is my success probability low?**
A: Your being's attributes don't match the crisis requirements well. Try:
- Using a different being
- Training the being's relevant attributes
- Attempting an easier crisis first

**Q: Can I cancel a deployment?**
A: No, once deployed, the being is committed until the mission ends. Plan carefully!

**Q: What happens if I close the app during a mission?**
A: Nothing! Missions continue in the background. You'll get a notification when complete.

## Tips & Tricks

### Efficiency Tips

1. **Plan your route**: Check map before going out, hit multiple fractals
2. **Stack missions**: Deploy multiple beings at once for efficiency
3. **Read daily**: Consistency bonus (7-day streak = 2x consciousness)
4. **Save energy**: Don't deploy to crises you'll likely fail
5. **Fuse strategically**: Wait until you have clear attribute goals

### Advanced Strategies

1. **Attribute Specialization**: Create beings with 90+ in one attribute for specific crises
2. **Balanced Teams**: Also have generalist beings (60+ in multiple attributes)
3. **Location Scouting**: Identify fractal-rich areas in your neighborhood
4. **Community Coordination**: Work with friends on global crises
5. **Resource Management**: Never let energy cap (use it before it wastes)
